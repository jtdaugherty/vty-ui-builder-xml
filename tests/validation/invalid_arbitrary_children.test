# This test checks that validation is not too loose in what it permits
# in arbitrary widget element positions.  This stems from an early DTD
# generation bug in which too many element types were included in
# %all;, resulting in document validation successes for documents like
# this one which don't actually describe anything meaningful.
Arbitrary elements not permitted as widgets
